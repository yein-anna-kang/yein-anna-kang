ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Anna Kang! I'm a Master's student studying Business Analytics at Duke Fuqua School of Business. I also studied Hospitality Management and Information Science for my undergraduate at Cornell University.  

ðŸ’» I'm adept at using a wide range of programming languages and softwares including Python, R, SQL, Tableau, SAS, SPSS, HTML, CSS, PHP, and `Stata, Adobe Analytics, Salesforce, SAP, and Advanced Excel (VBA, Solver, TreePlan, Crystal Ball, Sensit). Through various courses, research endeavors, and internship experiences, I found my passion for such areas as machine learning, statistical testing, econometrics, data visualization, business modeling, a/b testing, and churn analysis.

ðŸ’ž I am an avid traveler who has been to more than 35 countries around the world. My favorite places were Hawaii in the United States, Melbourne in Australia, and Barcelona in Spain. I love to make Korean food for my friends at Duke and enjoy baking cookies and cakes whenever there is something fun to celebrate!  

ðŸ‘€ I believe in the power of data that can turn ambition into reality. I would love to explore the intersection of business, technology, and analytics by working as a data analyst or data scientist.  

ðŸ“« How to reach me? Contact me via yein.kang@duke.edu or 984-484-6538! I am more than happy to talk with you about ANYTHING!
